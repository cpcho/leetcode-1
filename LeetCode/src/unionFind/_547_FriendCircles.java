/**
 * 
 * Problem: There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while
 * some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is
 * a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect
 * friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are
 * direct or indirect friends.
 * 
 * Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in
 * the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends
 * with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of
 * friend circles among all the students.
 * 
 * Example 1: Input: [[1,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,0,1]] Output: 2 Explanation:The 0th
 * and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. The 2nd
 * student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
 * 
 * Example 2: Input: [[1,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,1,1]] Output: 1 Explanation:The 0th
 * and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct
 * friends, so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in
 * the same friend circle, so return 1. Note: N is in range [1,200]. M[i][i] = 1
 * for all students. If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.
